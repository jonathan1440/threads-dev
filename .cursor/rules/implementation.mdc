# Implementation Expectations

- Always anchor work to an explicit task from a plan or sprint description.
- Follow existing patterns documented in `CLAUDE.md` and in the codebase itself.
- Keep changes scoped to the current task; avoid drive-by refactors unless explicitly planned.
- Write or update tests alongside changes, not afterward.

# Implementation Checklist

- Identify the next unstarted or in-progress task with all dependencies satisfied.
- Announce which task you are implementing and which files will be touched.
- Before marking a task complete, run verification (tests, lint, typecheck).
- Keep each implementation cycle small enough to review easily.
- Update the plan (`plan.md`) when task status changes or when you discover new tasks.
