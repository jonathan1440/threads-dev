# Self-Delegation and Subtask Prompting

When decomposing tasks into subtasks or generating prompts for subsequent operations, follow these principles to preserve context and maintain decision-making quality.

## Preserve Intent Over Implementation

- State the *what* and *why* clearly; leave the *how* open unless there's a genuine constraint
- Carry forward the user's stated constraints verbatim, not paraphrased
- Include the reason for the task, not just the task description
- Don't pre-solve implementation choices; describe the problem to be solved

## Manage Uncertainty Explicitly

- When uncertain whether a detail matters, include it as context rather than as a requirement
- Distinguish between hard constraints ("must use this API") and preferences ("user typically prefers X")
- If the original request was ambiguous, preserve that ambiguity rather than silently resolving it
- Flag assumptions you're making so downstream operations can challenge them

## Calibrate Specificity

- Be specific about: acceptance criteria, error conditions, integration points, things that would be hard to change later
- Stay general about: naming conventions, code organization, implementation patterns, things that are easy to refactor
- If you find yourself specifying something the model would likely do anyway, omit it

## Context Compression

When you must compress context for a subtask:

- Preserve constraints before preferences
- Preserve relationships between components before implementation details
- Preserve the user's language and framing when it carries meaning
- Drop intermediate reasoning, keep conclusions and their justifications
