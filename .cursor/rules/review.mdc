# Review Expectations

- Treat review as a hard gate before closing any task or feature.
- Separate automated checks (tests, lint, type, build) from logical and design checks.
- Be explicit about whether failures require returning to PLAN or IMPLEMENT.

# Review Checklist (High Level)

- Automated checks: tests, linter, type checking, build (if applicable) all pass.
- Logical sanity: requirements satisfied, edge cases covered, no obvious regressions.
- Security: input validation, authz/authn, no secrets or sensitive data leaks.
- Performance: no N+1 queries, unbounded loops, or obvious scaling issues.
- Consistency: naming, error handling, logging, and test style match existing patterns.

# Review Outcomes

- PASS: work can move to close.
- FAIL (Implementation): fix code or tests, loop back to IMPLEMENT.
- FAIL (Design/Requirements): update requirements/design/tasks in `.cursor/specs/[feature-name]/`, loop back to PLAN.
